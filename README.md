# KeywordBot
Keyword Notifications, similar to skype, for Discord!
--------------------------
Install guide:

First hit Download Zip, should be a button somewhere top-right.

Then go to this guide: https://github.com/SexualRhinoceros/MusicBot/wiki/Installation-guide-for-Windows-7-and-up

From the guide above, install git + python, ignore step 3 about MusicBot

run bestfixnupdate.bat to update dependencies. If you've followed the link carefully, everything should update correctly.

From here you'll want a new bot account that is ONLY connected to the server(s) you want notifications on.
Open options.txt (preferably in Notepad++, regular notepad can fuck things up) and replace the placeholder email/password with your own.

Finally run _run_KeywordBot.bat, should see a command prompt with "Connected!" and list of servers the bot's account is connected to.

------------------------
COMMANDS (Any user can use. No brackets needed.):
- !notification [keyword]
- !deletenotification [keyword]
